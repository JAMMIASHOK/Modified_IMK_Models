# Modified_IMK_Models
Contains DLL executables and associated documentation for the modified Ibarra-Medina-Krawinkler deterioration models (Bilinear, Peak-Oriented, Pinching)

-IMKBilin: Typically used for simulating the behavior of structural steel components

-IMKPeakOriented: Typically used for simulating the behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) components that exchibitÂ peak-oriented hysteretic behavior

-IMKPinching: Typically used for simulating the behavior of any structural component that is characterized by pinching
